**Welcome! You have showed interest in possibly joining The Tech Collective's _.tech that_ full stack team.**

You are about to set off on for a small exerecise which will probably take you 30 mins to complete. It's _not_ a coding exercise and it's _not_ a competition. You can't win or lose, there is no right or wrong. You can't be excluded or otherwise be ruled out. There are no dumb questions and there are no rules. So feel free to show som initiative. 

The purpose of the exercise is two-fold:

**ðŸ‘‰ For you** to get a little bit more information about what we do, who we are, how we work and hopefully enable you to descide wether or not The Tech Collective's _.tech that_ team might be a career you'd like to pursue.<br/>
**ðŸ‘‰ For us** to get some insigth into who you are, what you want, how you (like to) work and your perspective on things that are dear to us.

We assume you got here from an invite to a GitHub Classroom exercise[^notghclassroom]. 

During this exercise you will have your own GitHub repository. It's private, so only you and we can see see your replies and reflections. You will not be asked to create any code or build anything. In this exercise we only use the GitHub Issues in your repo to get your replies an refelctions. And if you choose you can even engage with us in the process â€” more on how to do that later.

[^notghclassroom]: If you _didn't_ get here from a GitHub Classroom assignment you are truely inventious and curious. But to participate you must enter from the [GitHub Classroom assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/rcXtBAsy) - Go there and accept the assigment â€” and you will end up here again, only in a different setting

If - by the end of this exercise - you still find that becoming a member of our team is attractive and relevant then the very last assignment is simply to use the link we provide to book us for a video meeting where we can go over your replies and refelctions and get to know each other a bit.

## How to do this exercise[^notghclassroom]

**ðŸ‘‰ Your first task is to create an issue... ðŸ‘ˆ**

When you hit the button "New issue" you'll be presented to a few different options. Use the [**Presentation**](../issues/new?template=background.yml) template The issue you create will present you to a small form.


#### ðŸ‘‰ Work those issues ðŸ‘ˆ

When the job is finished at the issues are copied over, you are good to go.

Continue there - in your own repo. Start by reading the `README.MD` ...it will instruct you further
